Calculating flow statistics and flow stress for MONTHLY data. Statistics are based on
Kennard et al (2010).

Kennard, M.J., Pusey, B.J., Olden, J.D., Mackay, S.J., Stein, J.L., Marsh, N., 2010.
Classification of natural flow regimes in Australia to support environmental flow management.
Freshwater Biology 55, 171â€“193. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02307.x

- This routine takes monthly flow data and calculates a range of statistics. It requires a BASELINE
  flow sequence as well as at least 1 SCENARIO sequence for comparison.
- As well as stats based on the full length of flow record, stats are also generated for 5 year
  blocks across the entire record. The distribution of 5 year block statistics is compared between
  the baseline and the scenario. The flow stress score is a measure of how different the two
  distributions are.
- A stress score of 0 means no statistically significant change between baseline and scenario.
- A stress score of 1 means the statistic has INCREASED entirely beyond its natural range.
- A stress score of -1 means the statistic has DECREASED entirely beyond its natural range.

- This file (FlowStress_main.py) is the core algorithm, opening input files and setting up calculations.
- The stats file (FlowStress_KennardIdicators.py) calculates the statistics and the 5 year blocks.
- The functions file (FlowStress_functions.py) contains a range of handy functions for some more
  repetitive aspects of the calculations, such as spells above/below a threshold, Colwell
  predictability calculations, or comparing distributions.

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------

Not all indicators can be calculated using monthly data! Some simply do not translate
to a monthly timestep.
The final statistic results will not include results for:
    ML2, ML3
    DL1, Dl2, DL3, DL6, DL7, DL8
    DH1, DH2, DH3, DH6, DH7, DH8
    TL3, TL4
    TH3, TH4
    All RA statistics
    
Not all indicators can be calculated in 5 year blocks! Calculating the 1 year to 20 year ARI peak flows
is not possible with only 5 years of data.
The final stress score results will not include stress results for:
    MH9, MH10, MH11, MH12, MH13, MH14

This section can be rewritten as needed for different situations. For a big model run,
the file naming may be simple enough to allow the files to be opened programatically
